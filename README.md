# wannabe-flappybird

Welcome to my Flappy Bird game project! 
This is my first-ever project, and it's also my first experience with Unity. I created this game as part of my journey to learn Unity game development. This project serves as a learning exercise and an opportunity for me to explore game development concepts, scripting, and Unity's game engine.

## Project Overview

- **Game Objective:** The game's objective is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes, collecting points by passing through the openings without colliding.

- **Learning Goals:** This project is a part of my learning process, where I've delved into various aspects of game development, including physics, player input, and 2D graphics.

- **Project Components:** The repository contains the Unity project files, C# scripts, assets, and scenes used to create the game.

## Features

- Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics.
- Scoring system.
- Obstacle generation and movement.

## Future Updates:
While the core features of the game are already in place and it's essentially complete, I have exciting plans to introduce additional features and improvements in the future. This project will continue to evolve, with ongoing enhancements and new elements to make the game even more entertaining.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible with the help of various YouTube tutorials on game development and Unity. I would like to thank the countless content creators on YouTube whose tutorials were essential in unraveling the mysteries of Unity. These tutorials have been invaluable in my journey to create my first Unity project.
